Prompt is the natural text that request generative AI to perform specific task.

# 🚀 **Prompting Engineering Structure**

1️⃣ **Instructions** - A Task for the model to do.

2️⃣ **Context** - External information to guide the model.

3️⃣ **Input Data** - The input you want a response for.

4️⃣ **Output Indicator** -  The output type or format.

# 🚀 **Prompting Engineering Types**

1️⃣ **Zero-Shot** - Zero Shot prompting describes the technique where you present a task to an LLM without giving it further examples.

Eg : 

Human : Add 10+10

Assitance : 20

2️⃣ **Few -Shot** - Giving the model more information about the tasks at hand via examples is called Few-Shot Prompting.

Eg:

Tweet: "I hate it when my phone battery dies.”: Sentiment: Negative

Tweet: "My day has been great”: Sentiment: Positive

Tweet: "This is the link to the article”: Sentiment: Neutral

Tweet: "This new music video was incredible” Sentiment:

3️⃣ **Chain-of-Thought** - Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting breaks down complex reasoning tasks through intermediary reasoning steps. Chain-of-Thought prompts are usually very specific to a problem type. 

Eg:

On a given week, the viewers for a TV channel were

Monday: 6500 viewers

Tuesday: 6400 viewers

Wednesday: 6300 viewers



Question: How many viewers can we expect on Friday?

Answer: Based on the numbers given and without any more information, there is a daily decrease of 100 viewers. If we assume this trend will continue during the following days, we can expect 6200 viewers on the next day that would be Thursday, and therefore 6100 viewers on the next day that would be Friday.
