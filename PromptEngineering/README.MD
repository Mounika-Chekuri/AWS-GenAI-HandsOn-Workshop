1Ô∏è‚É£ **Zero-Shot** - Zero Shot prompting describes the technique where you present a task to an LLM without giving it further examples.

Eg : 
Human : Add 10+10
Assitance : 20

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Few -Shot** - Giving the model more information about the tasks at hand via examples is called Few-Shot Prompting.
